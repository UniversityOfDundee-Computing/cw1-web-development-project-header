    <h1>Performance</h1>
<p>
    Performance figures are lower than a regular F1 in all aspects (apart from 0-30 mph (0-48 km/h)) relating to performance
    As Mario Andretti noted in a top speed comparison test after hitting the rev limiter at 217.7 mph
    (350.4 km/h) on Ameritech F1, the Ameritech F1 is fully capable of pulling a seventh gear, thus with a higher gear ratio
    or a seventh gear the car would probably be able to reach an even greater top speed.
